# HCI
Hash code indexing
###### Read me ######
We provide code for 4 steps.
1. Compute cluster member and count member (both modality image and text).
2. Compute cluster probability (both query and training).
3. Train model and test (train cross-modat x= image modality, y=text modality).
4. Evaluate
	(4.1) Computer exhaustive search MAP with hamming distance.
	(4.2) Computer MAP@R R=1 to 50.
	(4.3) Computer MAP ranking and no-ranking in clusters (We can set how many clusters we want to compute.)
	(4.4) Computer MAP mixed candidate with ranking and no-ranking.
