We provide code for 4 steps and input data.
1. Compute cluster member and count member.
2. Compute cluster probability.
3. Train model and test.
4. Evaluate
	4.1 Computer exhaustive search MAP with hamming distance.
	4.2 Computer MAP@R R=1 to 50.
	4.3 Computer MAP ranking and no-ranking in clusters (We can set how many clusters we want to compute.)
	4.4 Computer MAP mixed candidate with ranking and no-ranking.
